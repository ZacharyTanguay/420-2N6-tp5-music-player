# 420-2N6-tp5-music-player
This is a project I did in Prog2. It feels like a long time ago when I was just starting out... It's kind of fun to see what my skill level was like after only the first month of coding.

The teacher asked us to create a basic music player, so this is what I ended up with in the end. It's really simple, but back then, my mindset was more like, "if it works, it works."
